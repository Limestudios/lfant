This is a general tutorial for the usage of ShadowFox Engine.

- SOURCE MANIPULATION -
To recompile your modified version of the source code, you will, of course, need a compiler. I would suggest using GCC, as I cannot, for the life of me, get Clang to work correctly.
 -Windows:
	1. Download MinGW, and install it to whatever directory you want (preferrably a simple one like C:/ShadowFox/MinGW). I suggest using TDM-GCC as it is the simplest way to have a working and easily updatable GCC installation. Add your MinGW/bin directory to the PATH environment variable if you didn't use TDM-GCC (which does it automatically).
 -Linux:
 	1. Install GCC and G++ with your package manager of choice. With aptitude (which comes with, at least, Debian-based distributions), it is simply:
 		sudo apt-get install gcc
 		sudo apt-get install g++
 -OSX:
 	1. Install XCode and GCC/G++ will come with it.

Then you can compile the source with any method that you want. Be sure to define the target platform if it is different from the build platform, in the gcc invocation like so:
	-DLINUX=1
	-DWINDOWS=1
	-DOSX=1
This specifies which code to use in platform-specific situations.
